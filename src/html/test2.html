                Sure, a lot of web design involves picking the right colors and getting the coolest look for your pages, but when it comes right down to it, you probably spend more of your time worrying about where text will go and how it will look. 
                Such concerns gave rise to HTML tags such as FONT and CENTER which give you some measure of control over the appearance and placement of text.
